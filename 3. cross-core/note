1. run baseline to get the average time: 
taskset -c 3 sudo ./baseline
32

2. run race
taskset -c 3 sudo ./baseline

find the minimum value on the 3rd column with non-zero value

228

228-2-32 = 194 is the cross-core communication time, i.e. if the running time is smaller than or equal to 194, no data race is observed.
