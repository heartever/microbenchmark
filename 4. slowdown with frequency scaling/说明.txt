1. use i7z to monitor the realtime cpu frequency

sudo i7z

2. install cpupower to control the cpu frequency (outdated)

3.  We managed the CPU frequency with the support of HardwareControlled Performance states (HWP). We first enabled HWP by the writing to the IA32_PM_ENABLE MSR, then configured the frequency range by the writing to
the IA32_PM_REQUEST MSR.
